Overview
Design (Detailed Block Diagram)
i. You may draw this by hand, but use a straight edge at least
ii. make sure to identify and label the various clock domains
The detailed system description can start with functional and input/output specifications. Modules can be described in order from input to output, or from most to least important module. Illustrate the descriptions with the block diagrams and timing diagrams you have prepared; refer to these as figures. Don’t bother going into the details of very simple modules. However, do give detailed descriptions and figures for modules like your Difference of Gaussians filter stack.
Brief Description of Major Sub-Modules
i. Keep this part short
ii. Don’t bother telling us what we already know (DVI interface, ImageBufferWriter, etc)
Detailed System Description
Data Path
i. Connections to SRAM
ii. We want LOTS of details on your difference-of-Gaussians filter blocks,
connections to frame buffer and connections to ImageBufferWriter
iii. Down sampler and up sampler
Control
i. How do you deal with any addressing issues, including blank rows or columns?
ii. What was your general control design (e.g. multiple FSM, counter based
control, etc.)
iii. State diagrams and functional timing diagrams for key operations (e.g.
Ready/Valid signals as appropriate).
Design Decisions and Tradeoffs
Describe design decisions you made for clock rates, extra FIR padding pixels,  Moore vs. Mealy controllers, etc. 
What problems did you encounter during implementation and debugging? How  did you resolve those issues or change design decisions? 


 
DESIGN METRICS
a. Critical timing path for your design, and maximum clock rate
b. Number of 6-LUTs, BlockRAMs
i. How many more Gaussian filter blocks could be added within available
resources?
Division of labor
 How did you organize yourselves as a team? Exactly who did what?
Estimate labor hours spent in design/debug etc.

CONCLUSION
a. Summary of main features
b. What would you do differently next time
